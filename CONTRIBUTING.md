## Using `projen`

Please do not edit `package.json` or any other file with a "Generated by projen." message in it. Instead, edit `.projenrc.js` and run `npx projen` to generate those files.

`projen` allows us to easily stay up to date with project configuration from the CDK team and to comply with [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/) requirements.

See [A Beginner's Guide to Create AWS CDK Construct Library with Projen](https://dev.to/aws-builders/a-beginner-s-guide-to-create-aws-cdk-construct-library-with-projen-5eh4) and the [Construct Hub contribution documentation](https://constructs.dev/contribute) for more information.
